### Hi there 👋, my name is Iván
####   and I am a web developer :technologist:

:earth_americas: I'm form General Roca, Río Negro, Argentina.

I've been working my craft as a front-end developer since mid 2020, and started taking freelance jobs in 2021. Currently, I'm learning backend tools such as Firebase and working on my first couple projects as a full stack developer.

Now I'm actively looking for remote job opportunities, either freelance or hired.
Feel free to check out my portfolio, and do not hesitate in contacting if there's something I can help you with!

:keyboard: Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / FIREBASE

A little about me:

- I'm mostly a self-taught person. I like to have mentors, but I also like to choose my own study schedule so I rely mostly on asynchronous educational resources.
- I've been loving computers and technology since I was a little kid, but it was only at the age of 26 that I tried writing my first lines of code.
- Before geting into IT, I studied in a music conservatory for several years. I still play guitar and bass :guitar:
- :racing_car: I love cars and motorsports  Last year I got my first car and I couldn't be happier about it.
- 🎮 I also love games. I played Doom for the first time when I was 5 years old and never stopped since then.
